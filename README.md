Saturday Evening Hackathon with Ben Poon

## Summary

A console implementation of Mastermind--the code-cracking game--in JavaScript.

Produced just for fun, the core logic of Mastermind turned out to be pretty easy to model.

Ultimately, this was an excellent excuse for pair programming with MakerSquare alum and fellow Ben Poon.

### Future Extensions

* A web / graphical interface
